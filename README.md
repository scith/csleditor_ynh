# CSL Editor for Yunohost

This web application allows users of CSL based reference managers to search for citation styles and edit them. It's still an alpha version, but the Visual Editor supports all the features of independent CSL styles (AFAIK) and it should be possible to do real work with it.

It is an implementation of the [CSL editor library](https://github.com/citation-style-editor/csl-editor).
